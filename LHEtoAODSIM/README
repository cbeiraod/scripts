How to take a LHE file and run CMS simulation on it to have analysis ready files:
(many of the scripts are written to run on the LIP computing resources: T2_PT_NCG_Lisbon/NCG cluster/etc...)

myGenFragment_cfi.py is a config file for CMSSW, to be used in conjunction with CMSDriver to create CMSSW python files to be run by cmsRun or CRAB.
     Uses tauola to decay the taus

The Configuration/Generator package should be checked out, and myGenFragment_cfi.py should be copied to Configuration/Generator/python
Example command to run with crab:
cmsDriver.py myGenFragment_cfi.py --mc --eventcontent AODSIM --pileup 2012_Summer_inTimeOnly --datatier AODSIM --conditions START53_V19::All --beamspot Realistic8TeVCollision --step GEN,FASTSIM,HLT:7E33v2 --filein=file:/lustre/ncg.ingrid.pt/cmslocal/cbeiraod/TStauStau/TStauStau_50_0.lhe --fileout TStauStau_50_0_GEN_FASTSIM_HLT_PU.root --python_filename TStauStau_50_0_GEN_FASTSIM_HLT_PU.py -n 10 --no_exec

The configuration should be tested with:
cmsRun TStauStau_50_0_GEN_FASTSIM_HLT_PU.py


crab_TStauStau_50_0.cfg is an example CRAB config file to run the previous CMSSW config file, it will create two jobs, each processing 10 events.
Run with the following CRAB commands:
(Don't forget to source CRAB: source /exper-sw/cmst3/cmssw/crab/crab.sh)
crab -create -cfg crab_TStauStau_50_0.cfg
crab -submit -c TStauStau_50_0
crab -status -c TStauStau_50_0
crab -getoutput -c TStauStau_50_0
#crab -report -c TStauStau_50_0
(resubmit as needed to ensure job completion, don't forget to get output before resubmission)


If everything runs fine so far, the following scripts should run without any problems. These scripts scan the LHE directory and create CMSSW "cfi" and CRAB "cfg" for 
each LHE sample, these can then be run either locally (CMSSW "cfi") or submitted to the GRID (CRAB "cfg").
Run the script createCRABcfg.sh to process a folder, where the LHE files must be present, creating a CMSSW config file and a CRAB cfg file, to submit 
jobs to the GRID. The script does not create a log file, but outputs everything to stdout. To create a log file you can do the following:
./createCRABcfg.sh ~/local-area/TStauStau/ > log.log
or, if you wish to monitor the output while running:
./createCRABcfg.sh ~/local-area/TStauStau/ | tee log.log

Now, there should be 2 new folders, one named 5E33 and the other named 8E33, these use the two different HLT configurations (7E33 is a subset of 8E33 
for the HLT paths I am interested in). Inside each, for each LHE file, there should be a py file and a cfg file. The py file can be run directly with 
cmssw (with the command "cmsRun file") however if the number of events is large, this is not recommended. In alternative, one can run the cfg files with 
crab, this will create several jobs per file, each job processing up to 2000 jobs. These jobs can then be submitted to the GRID, just like with the 
previous set of commands. The number of jobs might have to be tuned.

The script runCreate.sh is a wrapper script to submit createCRABcfg.sh with qsub
